# THIS IS A PREDICTIVE MODEL ON QUALITATIVE ACTIVITY RECOGNITION

Here we consider the activity of weight lifting, the weight lifting activity is doing a bicep curl.sing devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

1. THE TRAINING DATA IS GIVEN IN THE CSV FILE.

2. THE TESTING DATA IS ALSO GIVEN IN THE SAME FORMAT, THIS CONSISTS OF 20 ACTIVIVTIES PERFORMED THAT NEED TO BE CLASSIFIED.

There is an Rmd file which has been knit to a html file with the code and explanation on the model and the reasoning for building it.
